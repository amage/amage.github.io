My work experiences in Comtek(Freescale) started with support job on [CodeWarrior for MCU](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/software-development-tools/codewarrior-development-tools/codewarrior-legacy/codewarrior-development-studios/codewarrior-for-microcontrollers/codewarrior-for-mcus-eclipse-ide-coldfire-56800-e-dsc-kinetis-qorivva-56xx-rs08-s08-s12z-v11.0:CW-MCU10) project. CodeWarrior for MSU is Eclipse Juno base IDE. C/C++ support is implemented by custom build of CDT. To track issues we used ClearQuest. Source code was store in AccuRev scm. I mostly did bug fixes. On this project I managed to improve build system by replace some of manual actions with ant build script.

Next project in Comtek(NXP) was [S32 Design Studio family products]( http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers-and-processors/arm-processors/s32-arm-processors-microcontrollers/s32-design-studio-ide:S32DS). It’s four products: S32DS ARM, S32DS E200, S32DS Vision and DS3.0. New project was started from scratch with new infrastructure: Jira, Jenkins, git. I developed build system based on maven and tycho. Jenkins was used as CI server but any user at any time was able to build any version of any product having only maven and git installed on her PC.
I adapted license system from CodeWarrior, switched it to new backend (jni bind) and redesigned it to meet new requirements. I participated to domain model design and backend implementation of New Project Wizard. Also I improved New Project Wizard performance by 2-10 times depends on cases.
I developed Import/Export subsystem for IAR Workbench’s ProjectInfo.xml format. This subsystem includes model matching and heuristics to minimize possible errors on import and export operations.
Also I participiated to Launch Configuration creation unification.

Technology stack and tools:
* Eclipse RCP
* OSGi
* SWT
* maven/tycho
* git
